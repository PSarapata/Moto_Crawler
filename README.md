Pushed first stage of my project. As per commit message, I read Scrapy documentation first, then found a nice commercial web scraping project example (real estate)
and based my first Spider on this code. Currently this spider feeds on input.json file, reads through the brand/model dictionary items and scrapes the car selling
website for offers. It then creates an output .json file with each car details.
