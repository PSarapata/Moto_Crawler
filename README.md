### Prerequisites
You will find requirements.txt file in projects' root. Main technologies used:
* Django (Python's framework)
* Scrapy (Python's framework)
* React.js (JavaScript's framework)
* Axios (for data transfer between Back and Front ends)

### Installation
To run locally I recommend to use virtual environment, mine is in the root, same directory with docs/, MotoCrawler/, 
react_frontend/. 
* First, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
* Then, go to core/settings and replace all the 
necessary data there (I cut the fragile data for security reasons).
* For Front, you will need npm, core.js, React, Material-UI (icons too), axios.
* Be sure to run migrations before you try to fire off django project.
