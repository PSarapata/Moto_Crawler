Commands
========

.. code-block::

    Commands module is currently not implemented.

Commands hold a custom Scrapy command, which on paper should allow to fire
off all spiders in a single one-liner "Scrapy crawlall", however the command does not seem to work as expected.
Furthermore, it breaks the default Scrapy behaviour.
