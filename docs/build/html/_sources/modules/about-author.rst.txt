My name is Pawel Sarapata and I am the single developer wannabe behind
MotoCrawler.
I started being serious about programming in 2020, I started in Back End engineering with Python and Django, however
as you can see, I am slowly exploring Front-End integration, and am hoping to become a FullStack web developer at
some point in the future.
